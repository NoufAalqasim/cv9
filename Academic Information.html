        As a dedicated student at Shaqra University, I am currently pursuing my studies in computer science at the sixth level. Since commencing this academic pursuit in 2021, my commitment to excellence is evident in my participation in a rigorous five-year program. Moreover, I have proactively sought to enhance my learning by obtaining certifications, completing relevant courses, and actively engaging in volunteer work. These additional endeavors have not only expanded my knowledge and skills but also allowed me to contribute meaningfully to the community.
